# Pod Racing Simulator
Games Engines 2 Assignment - Simon O'Leary - C15413218

In this project I will attempt to make a simulation of the pod racing scene from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.
In this scene Anakin Skywalker narrowly wins this pod race after a poor start. This scene will be created using 
movement behaviours such as path following and obstacle avoidance, allowing the racers to navigate the obstacles 
on the track. 

An estimated 7 cameras will be used in this scene and will track the progress of the pods, turning to follow their
progress where required. The assets for the pods will be custom made while for the terrain I will try find
assets elsewhere.
