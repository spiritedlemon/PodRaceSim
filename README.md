# Pod Racing Simulator
Games Engines 2 Assignment - Simon O'Leary - C15413218

This is a pod racing simulation created in Unity using a number of the movement behaviours outlined by Craig Reynolds in his paper: 
"Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters". There are 10 pods in the scene of varying size and design. 
They avoid obstacles using the obstacle avoidance behaviour & get their pathing from the 'FollowPath' script on each pod. 

Cameras turn to watch the pods as they go by. Camera changes are triggered when a pod reaches a certain point of the race. 
Two cameras move along side the pods on the long stretches and one close-up camera is used at the chokepoint in the middle of the lap.
The assets for the map are from the asset store and the pods were custom made using basic Unity shapes.
